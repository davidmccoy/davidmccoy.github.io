a:Tb99,<ul>
<li>Develop and maintain the leading tax credit platform that has <strong>delivered $200+ million of tax credits</strong> to customers and <strong>raised $75 million</strong>   in venture capital.</li>
<li>Lead the technical design and implementation of new products, e.g. support for new tax credits that <strong>increased revenue per customer by 10%.</strong><ul>
<li>Redesigned the data model backing our tax credits to be far more flexible and support multiple tax forms, as well multiple versions of the same form</li>
<li>Rearchitected our calculations to be composable, which made calculations  easily reusable/testable and significantly improved accuracy/maintainability</li>
<li>Built a new unified user experience allowing customers to manage all of their data in one place and claim all of the available tax credits together</li>
<li>Together, this <strong>reduced a new credit’s time to market from months to weeks</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rearchitect critical systems like our data import pipeline, which extracts and transforms third-party financial data into domain-specific models.<ul>
<li>Identified and documented issues with the previous system, then rebuilt the pipeline with a new library to align it with our existing infrastructure choices</li>
<li>Implemented a new queuing strategy to separate jobs into single-responsibility queues, support for job priority, rate limiting, and autoscaling</li>
<li>This work led to a <strong>500% increase in processing efficiency</strong>, the elimination of crashes, and a massive reduction in errors/incorrect data</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Design and implement ML/AI systems, such as:<ul>
<li>Document parsing and data extraction for tax documents, leveraging fine-tuned models and human-in-the-loop feedback for further refinement</li>
<li>Multi-platform tax chat systems powered by RAG (with dynamic chunking strategies), knowledge graphs, few-shot prompting, and user-specific data</li>
<li>A custom LLM evaluation tool to manage the documents for RAG pipeline, a wide range of domain-specific evals, and human-in-the-loop feedback loops, which <strong>improved LLM response accuracy rates from under 20% to over 90%</strong></li>
<li>Nearest-neighbor models to estimate tax credit values and classification models for expense/payroll data trained with internal data sets</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Maintain and support custom infrastructure, deployment, and data systems.</li>
<li>Contribute to organizational leadership by:<ul>
<li>Leading engineering teams, from product teams that build the core product to tiger teams that explore and prototype greenfield products</li>
<li>Representing engineering in cross-functional planning and strategy contexts</li>
<li>Helping to develop high-level engineering strategy, as well as designing and refining day-to-day engineering processes</li>
<li>Hiring, mentoring, and leading teams of remote engineers across all experience levels</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
b:T470,<ul>
<li>Architected new systems that transformed a seed-stage startup into a Series B startup that <strong>raised a total of $50 million</strong> in venture capital, such as:<ul>
<li><strong>A payment processing system that moved $10+ million a day at peak</strong></li>
<li>Calculation engines that supported loan underwriting and interest payments</li>
<li>Contract-signing services for various financial instruments/agreements</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Built features like in-app notifications and new loan structures/investment vehicles.</li>
<li>Led the hiring of an entire 15-person engineering organization from the ground-up.</li>
<li>Managed the development work of multiple distributed teams, including leading architecture and design - meetings, one-on-ones, code reviews, and agile rituals.</li>
<li>Identified and addressed performance issues across the application, ensuring service stability and efficient - cross-service communication.</li>
<li>Identified and mitigated security events and threats, such as financial fraud, DDOS, or spam attacks. Ensured the security of confidential financial documents and PII.</li>
</ul>
