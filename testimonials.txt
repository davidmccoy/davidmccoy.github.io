a:T676,<ul>
<li><strong>David is quite frankly the biggest driver on, and advocate for, our team.</strong> He asks the right questions, he is quick to execute on priorities, and he does an excellent job working and communicating effectively with everyone.I could not ask for a better Team Lead – and partner – on the team.</li>
<li><strong>David is exceptional at driving projects and filling the gaps, be it in engineering, or product, or process.</strong> This has been exemplified in the delivery of our new tax credits dashboard and the work we’ve done on optimizing out qualified research expense classification and calculation.</li>
<li><strong>He has led a campaign to move away from our default-waterfall engineering process to dedicated scrum process</strong> – a method that has proved to be highly effective and resulted in our teams completing their engineering work faster and in a more predictable manner.</li>
<li>He organizes engineering reviews, plans and builds out engineering work, and takes the lead during team meetings. He does this all while still making significant contributions as an engineer.</li>
<li>I see a lot of potential for David continuing to be a prominent voice for our product and our engineering organization. <strong>He cares deeply about what we are building and the people that are building it. He has done his part in trying to improve our fragmented culture.</strong> [...] David has done a phenomenal job advocating for a more iterative approach on launching projects. I would love to see him continue to grow as the driving force he is, and the integral part of the organization he has become.</li>
</ul>
b:T829,<p>David does just about everything well. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him less than 100% on anything he’s touched. A few things he’s done exceptionally well:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>He is an expert in [the business]</strong>, and therefore takes a nuanced approach to any problem. He has intentionally prioritized understanding the product, our users, the [business domain], our codebase, and the needs of the business. <strong>He has done this so effectively that he catches holes in product designs and implementation that nobody else would have caught.</strong></li>
<li>He prioritizes robust testing before launching big features to customers.<ul>
<li>We have had significantly fewer bugs this year than we did the previous year, and that’s in no small part due to David building testing time into his project plans.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>He continuously pushes for what he knows is right for the customer, and effectively highlights <em>why</em> it’s the right thing.</strong><ul>
<li>When I was on vacation this summer, he successfully advocated to extend the team&#39;s mission to meet a key customer need. As a result, we decreased the portion of customers receiving inaccurate [deliverables] from 65% to 0%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He creates a lighthearted, fun, yet focused environment <strong>so teammates feel safe to express their thoughts and make bold decisions.</strong></li>
<li>He takes the initiative to do what needs to be done, even if it’s outside of his responsibilities entirely.<ul>
<li>Examples include saving us from a $30k [SaSS] contract, performing a data audit, and [a proof-of-concept product experiment].</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>He gives really thoughtful and actionable feedback.</strong><ul>
<li>When I asked him for feedback on some [new product] onboarding slides, he spent &gt; 1 hour talking through all the tactical ways I could improve them. As a result, 100% of our first customer’s employees rated their onboarding presentation as a 5/5, and none of them were concerned about how the program works.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
c:T60d,<p>David is one of the most impactful people at [the company], and one of a handful who I believe are critical to our success with [major partner] and beyond. A little of what makes him so valuable:</p>
<ol>
<li>He enables PMs to make sound product decisions. <strong>He clearly communicates all possible options and tradeoffs, and makes recommendations that balance engineering quality with business needs considerations.</strong> We are able to move quickly and confidently because he intentionally gathers all the context he needs to make good recommendations, which in turn allows him to create alignment across the team.</li>
<li><strong>He gets the best out of his teams</strong>, whether by mentoring junior colleagues, generating consensus amongst disagreeing teammates, or making space for fun at work. If I am good at my job, it is in large part because of the time and energy David has put into guiding and supporting me.</li>
<li><strong>He transforms product teams as soon as he arrives.</strong> It is no secret that having David as your team lead means that your team will produce meaningful results quickly, guaranteed. This is well demonstrated by the [struggling team] situation earlier this year — we had been spinning for weeks without forward progress, but had a complete [product experience] within two weeks of him joining the team.</li>
<li>He is currently driving alignment amongst the [product and engineering] teams to ensure that we deliver the expected product before the [major partner] launch in January.</li>
</ol>
d:T936,<p>[B]ecause I don&#39;t think you hear enough how wonderful you are to work with, I&#39;ve talked with three other people this week about why you&#39;re the right person to lead [the next big project] and I&#39;m tell you the reasons that came up the most:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You&#39;re an all-around great engineer and creative problem-solver</strong></li>
<li><strong>You&#39;re an effective leader, especially in situations like [the next big project] where there&#39;s a lot to do at pretty high stakes.</strong></li>
<li>Your dedication to and passion for your work is infectious and inspires others to do their best.</li>
<li>You create a lighthearted and fun environment in group meetings so people feel safe to express what they need to express.</li>
<li>You&#39;re very supportive and a great mentor. I don&#39;t think the value of your support can be overstated.</li>
<li>You know the business and technical things that are important to make [the next big project] successful.</li>
<li><strong>You actually get [our business domain]. Not just conceptually but very tactically, and better than almost anyone here, including ops.</strong> You <em>really</em> understand business context and how it informs which tradeoffs we should be making.</li>
<li><strong>And when you don&#39;t know something you make it a point to learn it well. So well that you find holes we otherwise wouldn&#39;t have noticed until a customer did.</strong></li>
<li>You think about things holistically so we can make the right calls</li>
<li>You prioritize the customer experience in all its facets — ease of use, receiving quality deliverables, understanding the value of the product, etc</li>
<li>Because you get [our business domain] and business context so well, you know how to break down work in the way that makes the most sense</li>
<li>You&#39;re a strong communicator</li>
<li><strong>[Other PM] and I were talking the other day about how easy you make it for us to make product decisions</strong>, because you explain options and tradeoffs so well and your recommendations are always balanced with engineering quality and business needs considerations</li>
<li>Because I&#39;m the product lead on [the next big project] - you understand what I&#39;m trying to say and ask good questions to get me to think through the things I&#39;d overlooked</li>
</ul>
e:T50d,<p>David led [his product team] into and through a very successful [business cycle]. <strong>Many lessons were learned from the previous year, and David made sure we did not repeat any of the same mistakes.</strong> The exceptional planning he put into that team’s projects allowed us to sail smoothly even when he was out on leave. And as a result, no one left that team bitter or feeling burnt out.</p>
<p>David displayed incredible levels of leadership on the teams he was a part of. On [hist first product team], aside from the amazing progress they made on our [product] experience, <strong>David made the controversial decision to extend the target date so they can deliver the [new feature]. He weighed the value it added to the customer experience (and business) over the missed target - and it was the right decision.</strong> Thanks to this, we reduced the portion of customers receiving inaccurate [deliverables] from 65% to 0%.</p>
<p>On [a different, struggling product team], the mission was spinning its wheels for a few weeks. <strong>Then David joined - within two weeks the team was transformed and completed [the first iteration of the product experience].</strong> This was one of the best examples of David’s skills in project planning and engineering leadership.</p>
f:T82c,<h2>Ownership/Urgency</h2>
<p>David takes the projects he works on very seriously, and the business impact they have even more so. <strong>When I told him about how our backs were against the wall with our [SaSS] plan due to the way we had implemented [its integration] in the past, he jumped in without hesitation. What I thought was impossible to rectify in only two weeks, David proved otherwise.</strong> Because of his initiative to act and the ownership he embodied in implementing a solution, we were able to move off the [SaSS] plan and save $30k/year.</p>
<h2>Influence</h2>
<p><strong>David’s push to move toward more focused, intentional projects designed around shipping smaller milestones helped us to adopt mission-based teams.</strong> These have led to the successful launch of numerous new features. David also led those teams, and helped build the framework of how a successful mission operates. Even on missions he isn’t directly involved in, or ideas/concepts that have yet to be turned into a mission, David helps guide engineers and product managers. One great example is his work in advocating for a formal data model of our [core data that was (at the time) unstructured data]. The [team that later took that work on] was able to leverage that concept, and David worked with [that team&#39;s TL] and team on creating the designs.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>David was the biggest advocate for a more agile process designed to produce smaller, shippable chunks. This has reverberated throughout the [product and engineering organization] where we now see other members of the team breaking up work into milestones with off-ramps baked in. He also pushes us to improve the way we handle PR reviews, improving the PR review process and better setting the expectations we should have of one another on giving quality feedback. David plays a big role in showing up and helping refine our team building and customer-focused sessions as well. He helped us in building back up our engineering all-hands, and is always there for [customer support call/sales call] reviews.</p>
