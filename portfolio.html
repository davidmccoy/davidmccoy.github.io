Back then, it wasn&#x27;t uncommon for someone to set up a web server and allow anyone on the internet to peruse parts of it as a remote file system â€” just from within a web browser. Those sections of a website would rarely have an index.html file so the server would render the current directory as web pages using a &quot;default directory view,&quot; which was usually just a white background and a table containing blue links.</p><p>A part of me misses the aesthetics of that era of the internet, before things like Bootstrap or Tailwind popularized certain styles and hyper-optimized landing pages all started converging on the same, generic look. The look of default directory views is the exact opposite kind of convergence â€” the internet and websites were so new that those white pages and blue links had a feeling closer to being on the frontier, exploring the depths of some stranger&#x27;s web server. (Google initially retained some of that feeling, and in fact used the same aesthetic, when it rose to prominence...but it lost that sense long ago.)</p><p>When I bought my personal domain, I wanted to both avoid building a generic portfolio and have a little fun with the task in front of me. So I did what any sane person would do: I leaned hard into a joke-y, nostalgic aesthetic that few people remember. Is it a good idea for your personal site to be, quite literally, a joke? Specifically a joke that you have to explain? Is it even a good joke if I have to explain it?</p><p>Probably not, but I enjoyed building it anyway.</p><h2 class="text-lg font-bold mb-4">Restrictions Breed Creativity</h2><p>Programming is, at its core, a creative act. That often gets lost in the day-to-day work of software engineering, but it really comes to the fore when you are working on personal projects.</p><p>One of my favorite adages in that vein comes from Mark Rosewater, the Head Designer of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. For well over a decade, he has lived by the philosophy that &quot;<a href="https://x.com/maro254/status/176046057883578368?lang=en" target="_blank_" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">restrictions</a> <a href="https://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/22705729575/did-you-coin-the-phrase-restriction-breeds" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">breed</a> <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/making-magic/twenty-years-twenty-lessons-part-3-2016-06-13" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">creativity</a>.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This lesson is tied into a myth about creativity,&quot; Rosewater<!-- --> <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/making-magic/twenty-years-twenty-lessons-part-3-2016-06-13" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">writes</a>. &quot;Many people believe that the more options available, the more creative a person can be.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This is a myth,&quot; he continues, &quot;because it contradicts what we know about how the brain works.&quot; If you&#x27;re faced with a problem and you&#x27;ve solved that specific problem before, he says, you will likely solve it again in the same way â€” the opposite of creativity.</p><p>Instead, Rosewater argues that &quot;[i]f you want your brain to get to new places, start from somewhere you&#x27;ve never started before.&quot; Using a restriction, arbitrary or not, to force your brain to start from a new place off of the beaten path will help kickstart the creative process.</p><p>If I&#x27;m being honest, this concept is only a small part of why I built my personal site as a neo-default directory view and mostly a post hoc justification for the time I spent building something that isn&#x27;t obviously &quot;good.&quot; But, alongside my decision to use default directory aesthetics, I decided to try and mirror default directory functionality as well. And that is <em>definitely</em> a restriction.</p><p>So I limited myself to a table-like layout with narrow rows and columns. Nothing fancy â€” no hero images, slideshows, image animations, etc â€” and a mono font styled with a very basic color palette.</p><h2 class="text-lg font-bold mb-4">Kitchen Table Issues</h2><p>I learned to build my first websites back when those web server directories that <em>did</em> have an index.html were forced to use tables as the main way to achieve a non-standard layout. It&#x27;s an absurd thought in today&#x27;s age of CSS grid and flexbox, which have fully supplanted tables â€” even when building actual tables for a web page â€” but tables used to rule the web. But I never really felt like the transition to floats and clearfixes for layouts was<!-- --> <em>that</em> much of an improvement, at least until Bootstrap 3 made them predictable enough to commit to.</p><p>The visual layout of the default directory view is essentially a table, so falling back to the familiar old ways of table-as-page-layout-device was all to easy. I would obviously come to regret using a table...but we&#x27;ll get to that later.</p><p>The basic structure of the site was simple enough to translate to the default directory view as that view was literally used to visualize the file system of a web server. The top level pages would get their own links on the landing page, but figuring out the other parts of the site was where the fun was to be had: made-up server signatures in the footer, expanding table rows for details, etc.</p><h2 class="text-lg font-bold mb-4">The Latest Update</h2><p>I think it turned out pretty well â€” except for the use of tables. As I return to the site more than 10 years after I wrote the first iteration, it is clear that the unpredictable nature of the table element no longer cuts it. Plus, AI tools have come a long way and products like<!-- --> <a href="https://v0.dev/" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">v0</a>,<!-- --> <a href="https://claude.ai/" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Claude 3.5 Sonnet</a>, and<!-- --> <a href="https://cursor.com/" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Cursor</a> <!-- -->make work on my side projects a lot more effective. So I&#x27;ve re-written the site with the help of those three tools and am quite pleased where it ended up.</p><p>I wanted to play around with Next.js again, so I converted the site from HTML and vanilla JavaScript to a static Next.js app served via Github pages. v0 helped me translate the classic default directory view style into a more modern React and Tailwind setup, while Claude and Cursor helped me rewrite the the site to remove the use of tables in favor of CSS grid.</p><p>The site definitely isn&#x27;t everyone&#x27;s taste but I sure have loved working on it over the years. I should probably build a more generically good-looking site for those hiring managers (or any other poor souls that stumble upon this site) that either don&#x27;t get the aesthetic joke or just don&#x27;t enjoy it.

In 2018, the site experienced a catastrophic failure and lost the majority of its data.

I was able recover a large portion of the audio files that MTGCast users had uploaded, but that was the only data with which I could restore the site&#x27;s historical data. The result was very incomplete but I managed to re-host all of the recovered audio files under properly-organized RSS feeds.</p><p>MTGCast had already been down for a few weeks by the time I got involved. Given the level of data loss, I decided that rebuilding the basic functionality of MTGCast from scratch would be faster than recreating the previous WordPress-based version that had already begun to come apart at the seams.

It was built with Ruby on Rails and React.</p><h2 class="text-lg font-bold mb-4">Background</h2><p>I have played fantasy football with friends and family for over a decade. I love the game and have noticed that it has a very distinct ability to increase a fan&#x27;s engagement with an individual football game by almost always giving them a rooting interest in every game.</p><p>(The NFL certainly noticed, too, and put the full force of its marketing behind pushing fantasy football...at least until sports gambling was legalized and everything became a gambling commercial.)</p><p>I wanted to test the hypothesis that a fantasy game would have a similar impact on esports, my favorite of which is<!-- --> <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. Plus, I wanted to learn how to build a real-time application, so I chose this project as a way of accomplishing both.</p><h2 class="text-lg font-bold mb-4">Functionality</h2><p>Thousand Leagues supported multiple ways for people to play fantasy<!-- --> <em>Magic</em>. Initially, the primary game mode was focused on private leagues, where you could get together with your friends for a specific <em>Magic</em> tournament and snake draft your favorite players. That format was the inspiration for the project and was<!-- --> <strong>powered by web sockets and React to create a real-time drafting experience.</strong></p><p>Later, I introduced the pick &#x27;em format for use in public leagues that anyone could join. This was by far the most popular way to play on Thousand Leagues â€” I ran nearly 100 tournaments and gave away tons of non-monetary prizes.</p><p>On Thousand Leagues, a<!-- --> <strong>league could choose between two different kinds of &quot;players&quot; to draft: actual professional <em>Magic</em> <!-- -->players or specific <em>Magic</em> cards.</strong> <!-- -->The player data was sourced from a combination of event registration and results from the tournament website, as well as historical data and rankings from<!-- --> <a href="https://www.mtgeloproject.net" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">The MTG ELO Project</a>. The card data, on the other hand, was sourced from a combination of historical tournament metagame reports from<!-- --> <a href="https://www.mtgtop8.com/" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">MTG Top 8</a> <!-- -->and the specific decks registered for that particular tournament (if publicized by the tournament organizer).<!-- --> <strong>I built a flexible ETL pipeline to pull in that player and card data, process it, and then load it into the database so it could be presented to users during the draft.</strong></p><p>The results of the actual games of <em>Magic</em> were then automatically updated at the end of each round so that fantasy players could have as close to a real-time experience as a <em>Magic</em> <!-- -->tournament would allow.</p><p>I also had the opportunity to partner with a third party to run a custom <em>Magic</em>-themed March Madness event on the platform that drew thousands of players. Instead of drafting, players would create a bracket out of 32 characters from the most recent <em>Magic</em> set (called <em>War of the Spark</em>, so the event was called &quot;Spark Madness&quot;).<!-- --> <strong>This required building a new UI with d3.js to display brackets and allow users to predict the winners of each round.</strong> <!-- -->My partner then ran polls to determine the round winners and we gave prizes to the players with the most accurate brackets.</p><p>Unfortunately, <em>Magic</em> events went on a long hiatus during the COVID-19 pandemic and never returned to their pre-pandemic frequency or level of fan interest. As a result, I stopped developing the site in 2020.</p></div></div><div class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-[minmax(0,300px)_2fr] xl:grid-cols-[1fr_2fr_1fr] gap-2"><div></div><div><button class="flex items-center text-blue-600 hover:underline p-4">Collapse <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-chevron-up w-4 h-4 ml-2 flex-shrink-0"><path d="m18 15-6-6-6 6"></path></svg></button></div></div></div><div class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-[1fr_1fr_1fr_1fr] gap-4 hover:bg-gray-100 border-t"><div class="py-2 px-4"><button class="flex items-center text-blue-600 hover:underline font-bold"><img alt="Team Magic League" loading="lazy" width="130" height="24" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="mr-4 py-2 min-w-[75px] object-contain" style="color:transparent" src="/images/tdl-logo.jpeg"/><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-chevron-right w-4 h-4 flex-shrink-0 mt-0.5"><path d="m9 18 6-6-6-6"></path></svg></button><div class="sm:hidden text-xs text-gray-500 mt-2 border-l-2 pl-2">Built with <!-- -->Ruby (Rails), JavaScript</div><div class="sm:hidden text-xs text-gray-500 mt-2 border-l-2 pl-2">Gaming content and news site that reached over 2 million users annually at peak and 60% growth year-over-year from 2017-2023.
