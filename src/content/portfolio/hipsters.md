**Hipsters of the Coast** was gaming content and news site built on WordPress that reached over 2 million users annually at peak and 60% growth year-over-year from 2017-2023.

It employed a remote team of 10 and generated $100k+ in revenue, mostly through advertising.

The site was started by a group of Brooklyn-based friends in 2012 in write about our favorite game, *Magic: The Gathering*. I joined in 2013 in order to help my friends transition away from WordPress.com to a self-hosted version of WordPress.

I took on all of the web-related duties at that point. At a basic level I managed our servers and WordPress implementation (eventually transitioning to a hosted solution), but **I also redesigned and re-branded the site (including the graphic design) and built new features (like an advanced card hover plugin).**

In a non-technical capacity, **I helped run the content side of the business between 2017-2023, which involved managing our remote team of writers through the entire editorial process.**

Hipsters of the Coast ceased publication at the end of 2023.
