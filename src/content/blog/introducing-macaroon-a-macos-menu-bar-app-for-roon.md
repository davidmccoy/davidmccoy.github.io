I am always accompanied by music when I'm in my office, usually splitting my listening time between my well-established library of vinyl records and new music through mutliple streaming services. 

When listening to music, new or old, I like to keep an eye on the artist and track names. The Mac's “Now Playing” feature has never really worked for me due to the fact that it is buried in the the Control Center menu, so I have used various menu bar applications over the years to show a live look at the current track.
